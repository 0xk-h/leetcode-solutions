# LeetCode Solutions

A collection of my LeetCode problem solutions.  
Sometimes I solve the same problem in multiple ways or languages — all versions are kept here.  
Each file includes **time and space complexities** in comments for quick reference.

## Notes

- No fixed structure — I just drop the code once I finish a problem.
- May contain multiple solutions for the same problem (brute, optimal, etc.).
- Languages vary ( mostly Python ).
- Goal: keep everything in one place, nothing polished.

## About

This repo is mainly for personal reference — to track my progress, compare approaches, and have all my solutions in one place.
